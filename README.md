# genetic-algorithm
It focuses on finding a solution to a given Knapsack Problem by using a Genetic Algorithm that has been specially 
constructed to solve this kind of problem. In 1975, John Holland published a book (Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems)
which describes a new way to find solutions to search and optimisation problems called a Genetic Algorithm. John Holland was a
Computer Scientist at the University of Michigan who developed this algorithm to mimic biological systems by utilising evolutionary
ideas to help guide the algorithm’s search for an optimal solution. Evolution itself was discovered and described by Charles Darwin
in 1859 and is often summarised as “survival of the fittest”. Here, we can think of each solution to a problem as having some measure
of how fit that solution is to the problem being solved, i.e. its fitness.  By combining solutions with high fitness and removing solutions
with low fitness we hope that the algorithm can ultimately find the optimal solution, i.e., the best possible solution for the problem.
However, the Genetic Algorithm provides no guarantee that it will be able to find this solution.
